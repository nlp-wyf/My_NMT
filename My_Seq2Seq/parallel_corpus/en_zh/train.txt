That need not be the case.	但这绝不是必须的。
On more than one occasion, under both Trichet and former ECB chairman Wim Duisenberg before him, press leaks and the tit-for-tat responses they engender, made the Governing Council sound more like a cacophony of discordant voices than a serious deliberative body.	在特里歇和其前任欧洲央行主席德伊森贝赫（Wim Duisenberg ）治下，都不止一次出现过向新闻界泄露消息的情况，并带来以牙还牙的反应。 这让管理委员会听起来更像是个多种杂乱声音构成的不和谐音，而非严肃谨慎的机构。

The report, still on familiar ground, then goes on to criticize the Fund for acquiescing to European resistance to debt restructuring by Greece in 2010.
