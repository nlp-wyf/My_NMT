Despite these imposing obstacles to progress, there are reasons to believe that a cultural shift is afoot: researchers from geographically distant labs are forming non-traditional “federations” to combine their data sets, work on them collaboratively, and post the results for other scientists to analyze.	尽管有重重障碍需要克服，我们仍然有理由相信，文化变迁正在发生：来自相隔千里的不同实验室的研究者正在形成非传统的“联盟”，将彼此的数据集联合起来，在此基础上展开合作，并将结果提供给其他科学家分析。
So science must retain its claim to being natural philosophy, too.	因此科学仍必须保持其自然哲学的本来面目。
